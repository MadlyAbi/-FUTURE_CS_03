# Incident Response Report: Malvertising Attack Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository contains a detailed incident response report analyzing a sophisticated malvertising campaign. The attack leveraged Bing Search ads to redirect users to a fake Microsoft Teams download page, leading to a multi-stage infection chain with PowerShell scripts and a trojanized TeamViewer for persistence.  

## Contents  
- **Incident_Response_Report.md** – The complete incident response report.  
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** – Including malicious domains, IPs, and file hashes.  
- **Attack Chain Analysis** – Detailed breakdown of the infection vector and persistence mechanisms.  
- **Impact Analysis and Mitigation Recommendations** – Assessment of affected systems, potential damage, and strategic recommendations.  

## Objectives  
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:  
- Investigate the complete attack chain, from initial access to persistence.  
- Document Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for threat hunting and defense.  
- Provide actionable mitigation steps and strategic prevention recommendations.
